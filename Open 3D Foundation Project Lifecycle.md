# Open 3D Foundation Project Lifecycle

\[As of September 18, 2024\]

## Project Lifecycle Defined

This lifecycle document is maintained by the Open 3D Foundation, and its purpose is to:

* Describe the requirements for contributing a project to the Open 3D Foundation;  
* Provide a clear process for the contribution of a project to the Open 3D Foundation; and   
* Set milestones and requirements for different project development stages once accepted into the Open 3D Foundation.

The Open 3D Foundation may adopt or amend this document by a majority vote of both the Technical Advisory Council (“TAC”) and the Governing Board.

The Open 3D Foundation Project Lifecycle is a process that describes the stages a project may be admitted under and what the criteria and expectations are for a given stage, as well as the acceptance criteria for a project to move from one stage to another. It also describes the Annual Review Process through which those changes will be evaluated and made.

Project progression, movement from one stage to another, allows projects to participate at the level that is most appropriate for them given where they are in their lifecycle. Every O3DF project has an associated maturity level. Proposed projects should state their preferred maturity level. All projects may attend TAC meetings and contribute work regardless of their stage. 

# Stages \- Definitions & Expectations

## Incubation

Projects submitted to the Open 3DFoundation at the Incubation Stage are intended to be the entry point for early-stage projects. Characteristics for projects at the Incubation Stage may be one or more of the following:

* Early-stage projects that the TAC believes warrant experimentation.  
* New projects designed to extend one or more TAC projects with functionality or interoperability libraries.  
* Independent projects that fit the Open 3D Foundation mission/vision and provide the potential for a novel approach to existing functional areas (or are an attempt to meet an unfulfilled need).  
* Projects commissioned or sanctioned by the Open 3D Foundation, including initial code for Open 3D Foundation Working Group collaborations and “experimental” projects.  
* Any project that realistically intends to become an Open 3D Foundation Growth Stage project and wishes to lay the foundations for that.

**Requirements:**  
	  
To be accepted at the Incubation stage, a project must:

* Submit a completed Project Contribution Proposal Template to the TAC.  
* Provide such additional information as the TAC may reasonably request.  
* Present the project’s proposal to the TAC. Project teams should be prepared to present a detailed (20-30 minutes in length) overview of the project and speak to the information in the contribution proposal.  
* Be deemed by the TAC to add potential value or value to the mission of the Open 3D Foundation.  
* Obtain an affirmative vote of the TAC.  
* Obtain an affirmative vote of the Governing Board.


  
**Benefits:**  
The Incubation Stage benefits are outlined below.

* Neutral hosting of the project’s community and key assets (e.g., trademark, domain, etc.).  
* Access to the Open 3D Foundation collaboration infrastructure ( including GitHub, JIRA, Confluence, mailing lists, and Slack ).  
* A sponsor from the TAC to assist the project in reaching the Growth Stage and to facilitate collaboration with other project communities.  
* Right to refer to the project as a Incubation Project of the Open 3D Foundation and an opportunity to participate in events and other collaborative activities sponsored by the Open 3D Foundation.  
* Subject to applicable trademark usage guidelines to display the Open 3D Foundation’s logo on the project’s code repository.


Incubation Stage projects may be publicly announced, at the discretion of the TAC and Board. We often see projects in the Incubation Stage change scope and focus; the TAC aims to ensure that projects have the space to focus on building a solid governance and contributor base to grow towards the Growth Stage.

**Expectations:**

The TAC may request Incubation Stage projects to provide updates outlining its progress on completing the requirements for the Growth Stage before the Annual Review. If a project fails to provide these reports after a TAC request, the TAC may vote to remove the project from the Incubation stage.

Projects in the Incubation Stage are expected to move or have made demonstrable progress on moving to the Growth Stage within one year. Incubation Projects may propose to be reviewed to move to the Growth Stage during its regularly scheduled Annual Review; projects can also request to hold their annual review early if they have completed the requirements before its scheduled Annual Review.

At the project’s Annual Review, the TAC will vote to either:

* Move the project to the Growth Stage if it meets the requirements for that stage.  
* Renew the project at the Incubation Stage if it feels it will move to the Growth Stage by the next Annual Review.  
* Move the project to the Emeritus Stage. In this case, the trademark and any other assets will be returned to the project maintainers or an organization they designate.

**Moving out of the Incubation Stage:**

In order to move from Incubation to the Growth stage, a project must:

* Have completed and approved the Technical Charter and agree to transfer any relevant trademarks to The Linux Foundation or its affiliate, LF Projects, LLC, and to assist in filing for any relevant unregistered ones.  
* Have defined its technical governance, including:  
  * LICENSE file in every code repository, with the license chosen an OSI-approved license.  
  * A README file welcoming new community members to the project and explaining why the project is useful and how to get started ( follow the guidelines at the README checklist to create an excellent README file ).  
  * A CONTRIBUTING file explaining to other developers and your community of users how to contribute to the project. The file should describe the types of contributions needed and how the process works.  
  * A CODEOWNERS or COMMITTERS file to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository; document current project owners and current and emeritus committers.  
  * A CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT file that sets the ground rules for participants’ behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. By default, projects should leverage the Linux Foundation Code of Conduct unless an alternate Code of Conduct was previously approved.  
  * A RELEASE file that documents the release methodology, cadence, criteria, etc.  
  * A GOVERNANCE file that documents the project’s technical governance.  
  * A SUPPORT file to let users and developers know about ways to get help with your project.  
* Have achieved and maintained an OpenSSF Best Practices Badge at the passing level.  
* Have had a successful license scan with any critical issues remedied.  
* Have a defined project mission and scope  
* An overview of the project’s architecture and features defined.  
* A project roadmap defined, which should address the following questions.  
  * What use cases are possible now?  
  * What does the next year look like regarding additional features and use cases covered?  
* Community and contributor growth assessment  
  * The current number of contributors, committers, and different organizations contributing to the project.  
  * Demonstrate a sustained flow of commits / merged contributions  
  * A healthy number of end-users within the industry the project aligns with, that have adopted the project and that are identified within the project ( using an ADOPTERS file or showcased on the project’s website ).  
  * A credible plan for developing a thriving user community, particularly expanding the number of committers and contributors?  
  * Outline of the plan for the project to complete the requirements for the Adopted Stage  
* Obtain an affirmative vote of the TAC.

## Growth Stage

Incubating projects represent maturing but not fully realized projects. Incubating projects have an established technical vision and working project, but are still refining implementation, discovering (and adapting to) new use cases, and operating as an open source team.

**Requirements:**	

To move to the Growth stage a project must meet all of the requirements to move out of the Incubation stage. Projects preparing to be considered for the Growth Stage should prepare a presentation outlining how it has completed the requirements and present it at the TAC meeting where it is being considered.

**Benefits**

* Growth stage projects are eligible to receive the following benefits:  
* Be considered as one of the “Technical Projects” under the Open 3D Engine Foundation Charter and may receive support as determined by the Governing Board.  
* Neutral hosting of the project’s community and key assets (e.g., trademark, domain, etc.)  
* Assistance from the Open 3D Engine Foundation TAC to facilitate collaboration with other project communities.  
* Blog announcement or similar communication announcing the inclusion of the project.  
* Right to refer to the project as an Growth project of the Open 3D Engine Foundation and an opportunity to participate in events and other collaborative activities sponsored by the Open 3D Engine Foundation.  
* Subject to applicable trademark usage guidelines, display the Open 3D Engine’s logo on the project’s code repository.

To move out of the Growth stage, a project must:

* Demonstrate a substantial ongoing flow of commits and merged contributions authored by a healthy number of diverse contributors\*.  
* Demonstrable roadmap progress.  
* A significant number of end-users within the industries the project is aligned with, that have adopted the project and that are identified within the project ( using an ADOPTERS file or showcased on the project’s website ).  
* Provide evidence that the project is working towards achieving the best practices badge.   
* Have a technical lead appointed for voting representation of the project to the TAC.  
* Be deemed by the TAC to add value to the mission of the Open 3D Foundation.  
* Obtain both a 2/3 supermajority vote of the TAC and an affirmative majority vote of the Governing Board

\*Since these metrics can vary significantly depending on a project’s type, scope, and size, the TAC has final judgment over the level of activity adequate to meet these criteria. In general, it will be necessary to (at least) demonstrate that the project is not overly reliant on any one individual or organization and can remain healthy in the event of a departure.

**Expectations**

During the project’s Annual Review, the TAC will assess the progress toward graduating to the Adopted Stage. Projects can also request to hold their annual review early if they have completed the requirements before its scheduled Annual Review. At the Annual Review, the TAC will vote to either:

* Move the project to the Impact Stage if it meets those requirements.  
* Renew the project at the Growth Stage if it feels it will move to the Impact Stage by the next Annual Review.  
* Move the project to the Emeritus Stage.


## Impact Stage

Impact Stage projects are considered mature projects that generally are ready for production use. Projects at this stage focus on growing an ecosystem of users and are often being leveraged in vendor products or used by end-users.

**Requirements:**  
To be considered for the Impact stage, a project must meet the Growth requirements and exiting Growth criteria.

**Benefits**  
Adopted stage projects are eligible to receive the following benefits:

* Be considered as one of the “TAC Projects” under the Open 3D Foundation Charter and may receive additional resources or support as determined by the Governing Board.  
* Have a voting representative on the TAC.  
* Right to refer to the project as an officially adopted project of the Open 3D Engine Foundation and receive the highest priority for participating in events and other collaborative activities sponsored by the Open 3D Engine Foundation.  
* A blog announcement or similar communication announcing the graduation of the project.

## Emeritus Stage

Projects like products have lifecycles, and often in open source, the relevance of a given project can diminish over time. Nonetheless, having a home for legacy and no longer maintained projects within the industry is crucial for long-term sustainability and asset management. Projects with operational, contributor, and/or adoption issues are not necessarily candidates for the Emeritus Stage; the TAC will work with these projects to improve any of these issues.

Projects only can enter the Emeritus Stage by either:

* On request from the project itself, requiring a 2/3 supermajority vote of all active project committers.  
* By a 2/3 supermajority vote of the TAC if deemed to be no longer maintained.

In the Emeritus Stage, the project’s code repository administration is transferred to a designated individual by the TAC. No new features or bug fixes will be addressed unless it is deemed a security issue. The Open 3D Foundation will hold all assets in perpetuity. Emeritus stage projects will be considered “Technical Projects” under the Open 3D Foundation charter and may receive support as determined by the Governing Board.

A project can move back to one of the Incubation, Growth, or Adopted Stages following the guidelines for a project being accepted at that level.

# Project Contribution Proposal Template

## Introduction

This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for projects to be accepted into the O3DF. The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into the O3DF and new projects to be formed within the O3DF. Applications should be submitted by creating an issue in [https://github.com/Open3DFoundation/tac](https://github.com/Open3DFoundation/tac) using the Project Proposal template.

## Project Proposal Requirements

Project proposals submitted to the O3DF should provide the following information to the best of their ability:

* name of project  
* project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)  
* statement on alignment with theO3DF mission  
* link to \*current\* Code of Conduct (if one is adopted already)  
* sponsor from the TAC, if identified (a sponsor helps mentor projects)  
* project license   
* source control (GitHub by default)  
* issue tracker (GitHub by default)  
* external dependencies (including licenses)  
* release methodology and mechanics  
* names of initial committers, if different from those submitting proposal  
* briefly describe the project's leadership team and decision-making process  
* link to any documented governance practices  
* preferred maturity level (see stages above)  
* list of project's official communication channels (slack, irc, mailing lists)  
* link to project's website   
* links to social media accounts  
* existing financial sponsorship  
* infrastructure needs or requests 

## Project Acceptance Process

* Projects are required to present their proposal at a TAC meeting  
* The TAC may ask for changes to bring the project into better alignment with the O3DF (adding a governance document to a repository or adopting a Code of Conduct, for example).  
* The project will need to make these changes in order to progress further.  
* Projects are accepted via a 2/3 supermajority vote of the TAC.  
* Satisfaction of the requirements of the initial stage of the project. The TAC will determine the appropriate initial stage for the project. The project can apply for a different stage via the review process.
