No TAC members besides the chair appeared.  As an unofficial, non-TAC-member discussion, Nick and Naomi discussed possible strategies to re-energize the TAC and remind members of the benefits and responsibilities of the role.  One of the benefits / responsibilities is to be part of the workflow to ingest new projects into the foundation - not just to suggest which ones, but to actually vote on what new projects should be accepted, as well as what changes they might need to make or goals to achieve to get to the next stage of adoption by the Foundation.
